## Sequence of tenses

**Rule I.** The tenses in Latin are divided into two groups:

| Group | Indicative | Subjunctive |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| A. Primary tenses | Present. <br>Future. <br>Perfect with “have.” | Present. <br>Perfect. |
| B. Historic tenses | Imperfect. <br>Perfect without “have.” (Aorist.)  <br>Pluperfect. | Imperfect. <br>Pluperfect. |

Where we have a dependent sentence with its verb in the Subjunctive, the tense of the Subjunctive is determined by the tense of the principal verb. Primary tenses follow Primary, Historic tenses follow Historic.¹

The English will generally make it quite clear which of the two Primary tenses, or which of the two Historic tenses, is required in each case.

¹ The Historic Present may be regarded either as a Primary or as a Historic tense. The Imperative is always followed by a Primary tense.

## Final Sentences

**Rule 2.** Final Sentences (i.e. sentences expressing a *purpose*) have their verbs in the Subjunctive, introduced by *ut* when positive, by *ne* when negative.

### Examples

- Laborant pauperes **ut** divites **fiant**.

  *Poor men work to become rich.*

- Se receperunt **ne** consilia ab hostibus **cognoscerentur**.

  *They retreated in order that their plans might not be discovered by the enemy.*

## Consecutive Sentences

**Rule 3.** Consecutive Sentences (i.e. sentences expressing a consequence) have their verbs in the Subjunctive introduced by ut. When the consequence is negative we have ut non, ut nemo, ut nullus, ut nunquam, etc., according to the sense.¹

### Examples

- Tantum est periculum ut omnes terreantur.
  
  _So great is the danger that all are frightened._

- Tam celeriter se receperunt ut hostes eos capere non possent.
  
  _They retreated so speedily that the enemy could not catch them._

¹ The sequence of tenses is the same as for Final clauses, with one exception; viz. the Perfect Subj. is often used after a historic tense. But only use it thus when (a) the result is "momentary," not continuous, and (b) the result actually did follow. e.g. Tantus erat ardor militum ut nemo motum terrae senserit. _The soldiers were so engrossed that no one fell the earthquake._

In the following exercises (10-19) Final and Consecutive sentences are mixed. When the sentence is negative remember that a negative final sentence always begins with ne, a consccutive sentence never does. Therefore for "that no one" use ne quis in a final, ut nemo in a consecutive sentence; "that no ... " use ne ullus or ut nulius; "that never " use ne unquam or ut nunquam.

## Infinitives

**Rule 4.** The simple use of the Infinitive is as the subject or complement of a finite verb. It thus corresponds to the English verbal noun in -ing.

e.g. laborare est orare = _working is praying._

Here 'laborare' is the subject of 'est,' and 'orare' is the complement, just as, in the sentence 'laborare est difficile,' 'difficile' is the complement. This last sentence we usually translate "It is difficult to work," but the Latin is "To work is difficult," and 'laborare' is a true subject.

All verbs whose meaning is incomplete in itself require a complement, and this is usually in the Infinitive. We call
it the Prolate Infinitive.

e.g. 

- volo abire = _I wish to go away._
- conor laborare = _I try to work._
- possum vincere = _I can conquer._
- te sino proficisci = _I permit you to depart._

## Participles

Rule 5. English sentences which require to be translated by participles in Latin are not usually in the Latin form at first. The English has to be turned; e.g. "The Greeks, having captured Troy, burnt it," cannot go straight into Latin, because Latin has no Perfect Participle Active.

(a) Wherever possible, make the participle agree with the subject or object.

e.g.

- _The Greeks having captured Troy, burnt it._ = Trojam captam Graeci incenderunt.¹
- _The chiefs were taken and massacred._ = Capti duces trucidantur.

(7) Wherever this is not possible, use the construction called Ablative Absolute; i.e. a Participle agreeing with a Noun in the Ablative, the whole phrase being an Abl. of Manner or "Attendant Circumstances"; e.g. in the sentence "_Having taken the city, he marched on,_" the participle cannot agree with the subject because there is no Perfect Participle Active in Latin, nor can 'the city' be made the object of the verb. We therefore turn it: "_The city having been captured, he marched on_" = Capta urbe progressus est.

¹ Never write such a sentence as "Capta urbe, Graeci eam incenderunt." The Abl. Abs. is only to be used where the participle _cannot_ agree with subject or object.

[page 26]

1. Do not invent a Passive Participle of Intransitive Verbs. Saying "Caesare pervento" is absurd as saying "perventus est" for _he arrived_. Latin having no Perfect Part. Active, the only way to rener "Caesar having arrived" is "Caesar quum pervenisset."¹

2. On the other hand remember that Deponents have Perfect Participles with an Active sense, though their form is Passive; e.g. locutus = having said, aggressus = having attacked, ratus = thinking, etc.

¹ See the first part of Rule 26, p. 144.

[page 27]

1. "_Saying this, he fled_" is a loose way of expressing "_Having said this he fled_"; and in Latin must be "Haec looutus fugit." The Present Participle always denotes an action going on at the same time as the action of the principle verb, whatever the tense of that verb may be; e.g. Hoc jam moriens dixit=he said this while dying.

2. We must often use participles in Latin where they are not used in English.
 1. Where English uses two simple verbs joined by "and" or "but"; e.g. _Numa died and Tullus became king_=Mortuo Numa Tullus rex factus est; _He took him and slew him_-Captum eum interfecit.
 2. Where English uses phrases with prepositions or conjunctions; e.g. _He was killed while hunting_=interfectus est venans; _on the death of Numa_=mortuo Numa; _after advancing a mile_=mille passus progressus.
 3. Where English uses clauses denoting time, cause, etc.; e.g _When Tullus was king_=regnante Tullo; _As the soldiers would not follow, he remained_ = nolentibus sequi militibus, mansit.

## Time, Place, Space

**Rule 6.**

### Time.

To be expressed without a preposition.

| Sense | Case | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| Time during which | Accusative. | e.g. Triginta annos vivit. _He lived 30 years._ |
| Time when. | Ablative. | e.g. Tricesimo anno mortuus est. _He died in the 30th year._ |
| Time within which | Ablative. | e.g. Multis annis Romam non venit. _For many years he did not go to Rome._ |

N.B.

- Undeviginti annos natus. _Nineteen years old._
- Tribus ante (post) diebus. _Three days before (after)._  
- Abhinc tres dies. _Three days ago._

### Place

To be expressed with a preposition, except in the case of towns, small islands, domus, rus.

| Sense | Case | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| Place whither. | Accusative. | e.g. In urbem. _into the city._ Athenas, _to Athens._ |
| Place whence. | Ablative. | e.g. Ex Italia, _out of Italy._ Romā, _from Rome._ Domo, _from home._|
| Place where. | Ablative. | e.g. In urbe. _in the city._|

But to express place where use the Locative of towns, small islands, domus, rus, humus; e.g. Romae, Athenis, Corinthi, Rhodi, ruri, humi.

### Extent of Space

To be expressed by the Accusative without a preposition.

e.g. 
- Tria millia passuum progressus. _Having advanced three miles._
- Tredecim pedes altus (latus, longus). _Thirteen feet high (broad, long)._
- Castra ab urbe aberant millia passuum ducenta. _The camp was distant from the city 200 miles._

## Ablatives of Comparison, Quality, Measure of Difference; Words Governing the Ablative

1. Quid mollius undā?¹ _What is softer than water?_
2. Stătūrā fuit humili. _He was of low stature._
3. Multis partibus/multo major est. _It is much greater._

¹ The Abl. of Comparison is only to be used where two things are directly compared with one another by means of a Comparative Adjective. Otherwise use quam. The case of the noun following quam will be the same as that of the noun corresponding to it in the first part of the sentence.

e.g.

- Facilius est mihi quam tibi. _It is easier for me than for you._
- Balbi domus quam Caii altior est. _Balbus' house is higher than Caius'_

Compare with these-

- Facilior est somnus labore. _Sleep is easier than toil._
- Domus muro altior est. _The house is higher than the wall._

In these sentences we have direct comparison between the two things denoted by the nouns, and can therefore use the Ablative of Comparison.

## Indirect Statement

In the sentence "He said many things" the verb governs a noun as direct object. In the sentence "He said that I was unwise" a clause has taken, the place of a direct object. When in this way a sentence becomes the object of a verb of "saying" or "thinking" we call it an "indirect statement."

When the verb of 'saying' or 'thinking' is in the Passive the 'indirect statement' becomes the subject, e.g. nuntiatur hostem adesse="_that the enemy are near_" is announced. So with 'impersonals' like constat (_it is agreed_).

**Rule 6.** When a statement is made dependent on a verb of "saying" or "thinking" the subject of the dependent clause is put in the Accusative, and the verb in the Infinitive.

Verbs of "saying" and "thinking" include all such verbs as learn, perceive, kenow. .hear, pretend, inform, hope, promise, threaten-of which hope, promise, threaten are always followed by the Future Infinitive. The subject of the
Infinitive must always be expressed.

"I deny " and "I say that. . not" are both translated in Latin by nego. Never use dico ... non.

### Examples

| Direct Statement | Indirect Statement. |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Ille vir bonus est. _He is a good man._ | Putamus illum virum esse bonum. _We think he is a good man._ |
| Legiones sequentur. _The legions will follow._ | Dixerunt legiones secturas esse. _They said the legions will follow._ |
| Copiae advenerunt. _Forces have arrived._ | Senserunt copiae advenisse. _They perceived that forces had arrived._ |
| Urbs non capietur. _The city will not be taken._ | Negant urbem captum iri.¹ _They say that the city will not be taken. |
| Regrediar. _I shall return._ | Spero me regressurum esse. _I hope to return._ |
