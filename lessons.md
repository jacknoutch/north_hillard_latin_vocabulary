## Sequence of tenses

**Rule I.** The tenses in Latin are divided into two groups:

| Group | Indicative | Subjunctive |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| A. Primary tenses | Present. <br>Future. <br>Perfect with “have.” | Present. <br>Perfect. |
| B. Historic tenses | Imperfect. <br>Perfect without “have.” (Aorist.)  <br>Pluperfect. | Imperfect. <br>Pluperfect. |

Where we have a dependent sentence with its verb in the Subjunctive, the tense of the Subjunctive is determined by the tense of the principal verb. Primary tenses follow Primary, Historic tenses follow Historic.¹

The English will generally make it quite clear which of the two Primary tenses, or which of the two Historic tenses, is required in each case.

¹ The Historic Present may be regarded either as a Primary or as a Historic tense. The Imperative is always followed by a Primary tense.

## Final Sentences

**Rule 2.** Final Sentences (i.e. sentences expressing a *purpose*) have their verbs in the Subjunctive, introduced by *ut* when positive, by *ne* when negative.

### Examples

- Laborant pauperes **ut** divites **fiant**.

  *Poor men work to become rich.*

- Se receperunt **ne** consilia ab hostibus **cognoscerentur**.

  *They retreated in order that their plans might not be discovered by the enemy.*

## Consecutive Sentences

**Rule 3.** Consecutive Sentences (i.e. sentences expressing a consequence) have their verbs in the Subjunctive introduced by ut. When the consequence is negative we have ut non, ut nemo, ut nullus, ut nunquam, etc., according to the sense.¹

### Examples

- Tantum est periculum ut omnes terreantur.
  
  _So great is the danger that all are frightened._

- Tam celeriter se receperunt ut hostes eos capere non possent.
  
  _They retreated so speedily that the enemy could not catch them._

¹ The sequence of tenses is the same as for Final clauses, with one exception; viz. the Perfect Subj. is often used after a historic tense. But only use it thus when (a) the result is "momentary," not continuous, and (b) the result actually did follow. e.g. Tantus erat ardor militum ut nemo motum terrae senserit. _The soldiers were so engrossed that no one fell the earthquake._

In the following exercises (10-19) Final and Consecutive sentences are mixed. When the sentence is negative remember that a negative final sentence always begins with ne, a consccutive sentence never does. Therefore for "that no one" use ne quis in a final, ut nemo in a consecutive sentence; "that no ... " use ne ullus or ut nulius; "that never " use ne unquam or ut nunquam.

## Infinitives

**Rule 4.** The simple use of the Infinitive is as the subject or complement of a finite verb. It thus corresponds to the English verbal noun in -ing.

e.g. laborare est orare = _working is praying._

Here 'laborare' is the subject of 'est,' and 'orare' is the complement, just as, in the sentence 'laborare est difficile,' 'difficile' is the complement. This last sentence we usually translate "It is difficult to work," but the Latin is "To work is difficult," and 'laborare' is a true subject.

All verbs whose meaning is incomplete in itself require a complement, and this is usually in the Infinitive. We call
it the Prolate Infinitive.

e.g. 

- volo abire = _I wish to go away._
- conor laborare = _I try to work._
- possum vincere = _I can conquer._
- te sino proficisci = _I permit you to depart._

## Participles

Rule 5. English sentences which require to be translated by participles in Latin are not usually in the Latin form at first. The English has to be turned; e.g. "The Greeks, having captured Troy, burnt it," cannot go straight into Latin, because Latin has no Perfect Participle Active.

(a) Wherever possible, make the participle agree with the subject or object.

e.g.

- _The Greeks having captured Troy, burnt it._ = Trojam captam Graeci incenderunt.¹
- _The chiefs were taken and massacred._ = Capti duces trucidantur.

(7) Wherever this is not possible, use the construction called Ablative Absolute; i.e. a Participle agreeing with a Noun in the Ablative, the whole phrase being an Abl. of Manner or "Attendant Circumstances"; e.g. in the sentence "_Having taken the city, he marched on,_" the participle cannot agree with the subject because there is no Perfect Participle Active in Latin, nor can 'the city' be made the object of the verb. We therefore turn it: "_The city having been captured, he marched on_" = Capta urbe progressus est.

¹ Never write such a sentence as "Capta urbe, Graeci eam incenderunt." The Abl. Abs. is only to be used where the participle _cannot_ agree with subject or object.

1. Do not invent a Passive Participle of Intransitive Verbs. Saying "Caesare pervento" is absurd as saying "perventus est" for _he arrived_. Latin having no Perfect Part. Active, the only way to rener "Caesar having arrived" is "Caesar quum pervenisset."¹

2. On the other hand remember that Deponents have Perfect Participles with an Active sense, though their form is Passive; e.g. locutus = having said, aggressus = having attacked, ratus = thinking, etc.

¹ See the first part of Rule 26, p. 144.
