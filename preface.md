# Preface

The authors wish to explain one or two points with reference to the use of this book.

The arrangement of subjects is meant to adapt it for school use. If a definite section of the book be assigned to each Form, and the division suggested in the Table of Contents be adopted for this purpose, each Form will deal with some new kind of clause in the Compound Sentence, the first with Final and Consecutive Clauses, the second with simple Indirect Statement, and so on. *Pari passu* those subjects are dealt with that concern the structure of the simple sentence (Participles, Case Constructions, &c.). In dealing with the cases the book does not treat each case as a whole, but gives the most necessary constructions (e.g. those of Time and Place) to the lowest Forms, and other constructions later on.

The Vocabularies given for the separate exercises (p. 203) are meant to be an important part of the work. They are meant to be learned and kept up by revision. The authors have tried to bring in all words commonly required in Latin Prose Composition below the VIth Form, and any uncommon words required in an exercise have been given in notes, and not included in the vocabulary to be learnt. These Vocabularies are placed together at the end of the book, so that they may not be before the eye of a boy when he does an exercise in school.

The authors have tried to write the exercises so that no word or construction may be required which has not previously been given. This applies to the "connected pieces" (which begin from the lowest Form) as well as to the sentence-exercises. Each piece has been written expressly for the place in which it stands.

Each exercise is marked either [A] or [B]. This is to divide the section assigned to a Form into two terms' work. Either the [A] exercises or the [B] exercises will make a complete course, and contain sufficient practice in constructions. But it is recommended that the Vocabularies of both [A] and [B] exercises should be learnt in any case, and of course the Rules and help given at the
head of exercises are not repeated.

After some hesitation the authors have added a "General Vocabulary," collecting all the words given in the separate Vocabularies. This is meant to assist short memories, but not to supply again constructions, genders, etc, which should have been learnt in the separate vocabularies.

At the end of the book will also be found some further help in the way of Vocabulary: (1) A list of Military phrases grouped together (p. 244); (2) A list of the most useful Prepositional phrases (p. 236); (3) A list of the commonest Latin Synonyms (p. 239). These are to be learnt or referred to as occasion requires.

The rules on the Order of Words in Latin are grouped at the end of the exercises (p. 195). This seemed better than scattering them throughout the book, or trying to bring each in where first required. But the more elementary of them are required in the earliest exercises.

Before beginning this book a boy should be able to translate simple sentences (including easy questions and commands) into Latin, and should understand the rules of agreement, the use of the Passive Voice, the simplest uses of Pronouns and Prepositions, and the easiest Case constructions. (Ablative of Instrument, Agent, Cause; Dative of Indirect Object and Possessor; Accusative after Factitive Verbs, etc.) But for the occasional revision of this elementary work the "Preliminary Exercises" (A to K) are prefixed.

The thanks of the authors are due to many colleagues at Clifton for suggestions, and especially to the late Mr. E. N. P. Moor, to Mr. W. W. Asquith, and Mr. E. H. C. Smith, for kindness in reading through proofs. They wish to acknowledge also the great assistance given them in making the vocabularies by Mr. R. D. Budworth, of Magdalen College, and Mr. E. G. North, of Keble College, Oxford. It should be mentioned that the book has been used in a privately printed edition at Clifton College during the last two terms, and that the present edition has therefore benefited by the experience thus gained.
