## Sequence of tenses

**Rule I.** The tenses in Latin are divided into two groups:

| Group | Indicative | Subjunctive |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| A. Primary tenses | Present. <br>Future. <br>Perfect with “have.” | Present. <br>Perfect. |
| B. Historic tenses | Imperfect. <br>Perfect without “have.” (Aorist.)  <br>Pluperfect. | Imperfect. <br>Pluperfect. |

Where we have a dependent sentence with its verb in the Subjunctive, the tense of the Subjunctive is determined by the tense of the principal verb. Primary tenses follow Primary, Historic tenses follow Historic.[^1]

The English will generally make it quite clear which of the two Primary tenses, or which of the two Historic tenses, is required in each case.

## Exercise 1.

In the following sentences Latin requires the dependent verb to be in the Subjunctive. Say (without translating) what tense you would put it in.

1. They have come in order that they may conquer us.
2. They sent money that we might buy our freedom.
3. We had already succeeded so well that we hoped to win.
4. We are so tired that we cannot work.
5. He ran so quickly that no one could catch him.
6. We do not know what he is doing.
7. Have you heard what he has done?
8. They did not know what the island was like.
9. We shall ask what he is doing.
10. We asked whether the war had been finished.
11. I do not know how many ships there were.
12. We were wondering why you feared us.
13. Tell me why you are afraid.
14. We shall work in order that we may become rich.

## Final Sentences

**Rule 2.** Final Sentences (i.e. sentences expressing a *purpose*) have their verbs in the Subjunctive, introduced by *ut* when positive, by *ne* when negative.

### Examples

- Laborant pauperes **ut** divites **fiant**.

  *Poor men work to become rich.*

- Se receperunt **ne** consilia ab hostibus **cognoscerentur**.

## Exercise 63 [A].

The Greeks valued their liberty so highly that they determined to resist the Persians and never' yield to them. Themistocles was put in command of the Greek forces. By his advice the Greeks trusted to their ships, and fought the Persians2 by sea. The Greek fleet was near the island of Salainis,8 and most of the leaders wished to withdraw from this place, and leave Athens in the hands of the Persians; for they valued their own safety more than the city of Athens. Then Themistocles declared that he and the Athenians4 would sail to Athens with the fleet of two hundred ships. But he was not able to persuade the others

## Exercise 64 [A].

Thereupon5 Themistocles formed the following6 plan to save both Athens and the other States of Greece. He sent a messenger secretly to the king of the Persians to tell him that the Greeks were about to depart. He pointed out that the Persians with their large fleet would easily surround the small forces of the Greeks. There are some who' say that by this advice he wished to please the king, and that he put his own safety before the freedom of his country. But the advice was of great service to Greece; for the ships of the Persians hindered one another,8 and the Greeks routed the enemy.

## Exercise 65 [A].

In the battle which Caesar fought in that place with the Gauls he lost many of his men. For when he had arrived at the top of a hill, and had begun to fortify a camp, suddenly the enemy made an attack. The Romans, who were not standing in line of battle, at first were unable to resist, and took to flight; but afterwards Caesar sent the tenth legion, which he had with him,1 to their aid, and at last the Gauls were driven down to the river. Here, however, they again made a stand, and Caesar himself says that they fought very bravely.

## Exercise 66 [A].

When the king was told of this, he sent an officer2 with 150 soldiers to take the robbers and bring them to him. On arriving at the place where the robbers were, they found that a very strong camp had been made in a wood, and that all the approaches had been blocked by cutting down trees.3 At length, however, the place was storined, and the robbers being taken were put to death but the king pardoned the leader's son, a boy twelve years old.

## Exercise 67 [B].

When the crops began to ripen the general marched through the wood, making use of1 a guide whom his horsemen had taken prisoner. On his march he sent out scouts to discover the enemy's camp. They having returned informed him that the enemy with their wives and children and a large number of cattle had made a camp in the middle of the marsh, and were awaiting his arrival. When he learnt this he advanced so quickly that he reached their camp at midnight; and such was the bravery of the Romans that few of the Germans escaped in safety.

## Exercise 68 [B].

Calenus received a letter from Caesar, who told him that all the harbours and the shore were held by the enemy. On hearing this he recalled all his ships; but one of them, which did not obey liis orders, was captured by Bibulus. All the sailors were put to death by the cruel general; he spared neither man nor boy, and hoped by his cruelty to finish the war more quickly. But Calenus pursued his fleet with 40 ships, and defeated him at Oricum three days after the massacre.

## Exercise 69 [B].

The kings of England and Germany declared war against Philip,1 king of France. They felt sure that they would conquer him, on account of the number2 of their troops, and because they held the French forces in small esteem. Nevertheless he defeated them in a great battle at Bovinium. It was a desperate battle,3 and all showed the greatest bravery. It was observed that a certain priest had killed great numbers? of the enemy. The weapon which he used was an iron club. He had chosen this because he declared that a priest ought not to shed human blood,4 and by this means his enemies died from the violence of the blow.

## Exercise 70 [B].

The French king himself was the bravest knight in his army. He himself was wounded, and his horse was killed under him; but he rose immediately, and led his men again against the enemy. They charged a squadron of Germans, amongst whom was the emperor himself. The Germans, thinking5 that their emperor would be taken prisoner, came up to his help, and opened for him a way of escape. Thereupon Philip remarked to his men that they would only see the emperor's back on that day. After the flight of the emperor the French pursued his army, and defeated them with great slaughter.
