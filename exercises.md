The wife replied that she did not wish to be idle, and promised that she would go to the fields the next day. The husband accordingly stayed at home to prepare the supper, but not being skilled in1 such things he prepared nothing which they could2 eat in the evening; and in the morning he said he would rather work and eat than sleep and be hungry.

The Roman general demanded these before night; but the citizens refused5 to obey the order: they said that they would rather die than accept such a peace. And accordingly the city was blockaded for four months. Then the Romans withdrew to defend their own territories against the Suevi.

The Greeks valued their liberty so highly that they determined to resist the Persians and never' yield to them. Themistocles was put in command of the Greek forces. By his advice the Greeks trusted to their ships, and fought the Persians2 by sea. The Greek fleet was near the island of Salainis,8 and most of the leaders wished to withdraw from this place, and leave Athens in the hands of the Persians; for they valued their own safety more than the city of Athens. Then Themistocles declared that he and the Athenians4 would sail to Athens with the fleet of two hundred ships. But he was not able to persuade the others

## Exercise 64 [A].

Thereupon5 Themistocles formed the following6 plan to save both Athens and the other States of Greece. He sent a messenger secretly to the king of the Persians to tell him that the Greeks were about to depart. He pointed out that the Persians with their large fleet would easily surround the small forces of the Greeks. There are some who' say that by this advice he wished to please the king, and that he put his own safety before the freedom of his country. But the advice was of great service to Greece; for the ships of the Persians hindered one another,8 and the Greeks routed the enemy.

## Exercise 65 [A].

In the battle which Caesar fought in that place with the Gauls he lost many of his men. For when he had arrived at the top of a hill, and had begun to fortify a camp, suddenly the enemy made an attack. The Romans, who were not standing in line of battle, at first were unable to resist, and took to flight; but afterwards Caesar sent the tenth legion, which he had with him,1 to their aid, and at last the Gauls were driven down to the river. Here, however, they again made a stand, and Caesar himself says that they fought very bravely.

## Exercise 66 [A].

When the king was told of this, he sent an officer2 with 150 soldiers to take the robbers and bring them to him. On arriving at the place where the robbers were, they found that a very strong camp had been made in a wood, and that all the approaches had been blocked by cutting down trees.3 At length, however, the place was storined, and the robbers being taken were put to death but the king pardoned the leader's son, a boy twelve years old.

## Exercise 67 [B].

When the crops began to ripen the general marched through the wood, making use of1 a guide whom his horsemen had taken prisoner. On his march he sent out scouts to discover the enemy's camp. They having returned informed him that the enemy with their wives and children and a large number of cattle had made a camp in the middle of the marsh, and were awaiting his arrival. When he learnt this he advanced so quickly that he reached their camp at midnight; and such was the bravery of the Romans that few of the Germans escaped in safety.

## Exercise 68 [B].

Calenus received a letter from Caesar, who told him that all the harbours and the shore were held by the enemy. On hearing this he recalled all his ships; but one of them, which did not obey liis orders, was captured by Bibulus. All the sailors were put to death by the cruel general; he spared neither man nor boy, and hoped by his cruelty to finish the war more quickly. But Calenus pursued his fleet with 40 ships, and defeated him at Oricum three days after the massacre.

## Exercise 69 [B].

The kings of England and Germany declared war against Philip,1 king of France. They felt sure that they would conquer him, on account of the number2 of their troops, and because they held the French forces in small esteem. Nevertheless he defeated them in a great battle at Bovinium. It was a desperate battle,3 and all showed the greatest bravery. It was observed that a certain priest had killed great numbers? of the enemy. The weapon which he used was an iron club. He had chosen this because he declared that a priest ought not to shed human blood,4 and by this means his enemies died from the violence of the blow.

## Exercise 70 [B].

The French king himself was the bravest knight in his army. He himself was wounded, and his horse was killed under him; but he rose immediately, and led his men again against the enemy. They charged a squadron of Germans, amongst whom was the emperor himself. The Germans, thinking5 that their emperor would be taken prisoner, came up to his help, and opened for him a way of escape. Thereupon Philip remarked to his men that they would only see the emperor's back on that day. After the flight of the emperor the French pursued his army, and defeated them with great slaughter.

## Exercise 81 [A]

In the evening a spy was caught by the guards at the gate of the town. Being brought to the commander of the garrison he fell down, and besought him with tears to spare him. He said he could persuade many of the besieging army to desert, and promised to assassinate their general. But the commander said he did not wage war in that way; and he ordered the guards to conduct the man to the enemy’s camp. At the same time he sent a letter to the general, in which he advised him not to make use of traitors again—for (said he) they are always willing to betray their masters to save their own lives.

## Exercise 82 [B]

After this battle the Spartan commander sent a messenger to Sparta to tell the citizens that their good fortune had been lost, Mindarus slain, and that the soldiers were dying of starvation.

At length the Athenians, being compelled by famine, surrendered their city, and became allies of the Spartans.

On the next day the English advanced by forced marches with the intention of attacking the French off their guard.

But the French general told his men not to fire back, but to allow the English to approach the bottom of the mound.

Then when the signal was given the French charged with such force that the English were routed and took to flight.

Eurystheus then set Hercules the eleventh labour, which was harder than those which we have mentioned above. For he ordered him to take away the golden apples from the gardens of the Hesperides. These were nymphs of remarkable beauty, who lived in a distant land, and some golden apples had been entrusted to them by Juno. Many men had before this tried to take away these apples; but it was a difficult thing to do, for the garden in which the apples were was surrounded by a high wall on all sides. Moreover a dragon, which had a hundred heads, guarded the gate of the garden carefully by day and night.

## Exercise 93 [A]

Hearing that the Belgae were conspiring against the Romans, Caesar determined to go himself without delay to central Gaul with two legions, ordering the rest to follow in a few days.

They said that the rest of the Belgae were under arms, and that the Germans had joined them. On hearing this, Caesar promised to come with all possible speed to the help of the Remi, that having joined their forces they might repel the invasion of the Germans.

## Exercise 94 [A]

The Romans, having set out about the third watch, advanced with great caution, for they had been informed that the enemy were close at hand. They advanced until late in the night, and then were told to pitch their camp.

But when the enemy perceived that they had not been able to attack our men off their guard, the signal for retreat was given, and they withdrew.

## Exercise 95 [B]

Louis could not at this time besiege Tunis, because he had not received reinforcements from his brother Charles, King of Sicily; and meanwhile his army was attacked by a disease which carried off the greater part of his soldiers in a few days. The king himself was seized with the disease, and felt that he would die of it. But, to sustain the courage of his soldiers, he performed all the duties of a king, and attended in every way to the safety of the camp. But at last he was compelled to remain within his tent, and before long² died, after telling his men never to abandon the siege.

## Exercise 96 [B]

At last, when winter was approaching, and all had begun to give up hope, a messenger was seen at a distance who was approaching the city with great speed. The citizens all rushed out to meet him, and implored him to tell them without delay about the army. So tired was the messenger by his journey that at first he could not speak; but at length he said that the army had both won many victories and taken many towns of the enemy, and that the soldiers hoped in a short time to return home with a great quantity of booty and many prisoners.

## Exercise 97 [B]

As the people of Veii often made incursions for the sake of plunder, the Romans were scarcely able to defend their own territories. Their soldiers went home to their fields in the spring to sow, and in the autumn to gather the harvest, at which times the Veientines did a great deal of harm to their lands. At last the Fabii promised the Senate that they would be under arms the whole year, and undertake the whole war themselves. The Senate thanked them, and going out from Rome they made a camp near the river Cremera. For a little time they checked the Veientines, but at length they were surrounded, and slaughtered to a man.

## Exercise 98 [B]

We set out from Moscow about the third watch, so that no disturbance might be excited by our friends. I never expected to see my brothers again. For thirty‑three days we marched along a road covered by snow a foot deep. Sometimes one of us fell down, and was unable to move further. Our guards did not try to urge him on, for they knew well that the wolves would have him for their prey before the next day. I now often envy those who were thus left on the road, and prefer death to the evils which daily press upon me. I am compelled to work, but that is the least of my ills; I am compelled to see the sufferings of the women who with us dared everything for the sake of liberty.

## Exercise 106 [A]

Our men saw that they were surrounded on all sides; and no opportunity being left for retreating, they resolved to charge with all their might in the hope of striking terror into the enemy. They knew that they had been brought into these dangers by delaying too long before, and they hoped that by fighting bravely now they would force the enemy to give ground. Therefore, when the signal for advance was given, they ran forward with a loud shout against that part of the line which seemed weakest. The enemy were thrown into such confusion by this unexpected attack that their line was broken at once, and no one resisted our charge.

## Exercise 107 [A]

A messenger had been sent to France to ask for help, and to invite French troops to Ireland. Arms and money were promised for the purpose of assisting an Irish army. These were conveyed by a French ship, and a hundred men assembled on the shore to receive the arms which it was going to land. But in a storm two of their boats had been broken, and in repairing them time was wasted. Meanwhile, to scatter the rebels, a troop of horse had been sent out from Cork, at the sight of whom the rebels fled in all directions; and to effect their own escape the French sailors threw the arms overboard; they lie sunk in the harbour to this day.

## Exercise 108 [B]

The French general was unwilling to attack us at close quarters, because his troops were inexperienced in battle, and he thought they would fight best when sheltered by ramparts. Moreover, three years before his troops had been unable to resist the English hand to hand, but having been withdrawn into the town, had defended the walls obstinately. The recollection of that time and the desire to prolong the war induced him to remain where he was. However, in order to give the Belgians an opportunity of deserting us, he sent out troops of cavalry as far as our outposts. But for fear of this we employed no Belgians as sentinels. For throughout the whole year we were expecting every day they would desert us.

## Exercise 109 [B]

The Athenians hoped that a Spartan army would march into Boeotia, and had taken no measures to save their families and property. Therefore they saw with the utmost fear and dismay that the Barbarians were advancing with all their forces for the sake of attacking their city. It was evident that in six days Xerxes would be at Athens, and this seemed a very short time for removing the population of a whole city. But they knew that it was of the greatest importance to them to accomplish this, and before his arrival they had safely removed all who were willing to leave their homes. Some were taken to Aegina, others to Troezen; but many could not be induced to proceed farther than Salamis.

## Exercise 118 [A]

It is said that a certain prophetess brought nine books to Tarquin, king of Rome, and asked him if he wished to buy them. The king asked for what price she was willing to sell them; to which she replied that she would sell them for three hundred pieces of gold. The woman went away, but afterwards she returned with six books. Tarquin asked where she had left the others, and she replied that she had burnt them, but that she would sell him these for the same price. Tarquin would not buy them, and she again left him. But once more she returned with only three books, and asked whether he was willing to buy these at the same price or not.

## Exercise 119 [A]

The king, who wondered why she had returned so often, now asked his senate whether he ought to keep them. They first asked him what sort of books they were, and if the prophetess had shown them to him. The king replied that she had said nothing, but that she had burnt six books out of nine, and now offered three at the same price. It seemed doubtful to the senators what they ought to do, but at last they advised the king to buy the books. Then the woman, having received the money, advised the Romans to keep the books very carefully, and went away.

## Exercise 120 [A]

The story is told of King Tarquin that he once determined to add new companies to the Roman knights. Attius the augur said it could not be done. Moved by anger the king demanded that he should show by a sign what the gods wished. Attius replied that he would tell the king what he had in his mind. But Tarquin said, “Tell me rather whether that which I have in my mind can be done.” “It can be done,” said Attius. Then the king bade him cut a whetstone in two, for he said he was thinking of that. Without any delay (so they relate) Attius cleft it with a razor.

## Exercise 121 [B]

In the following year Cleon was sent to Macedonia to recover the cities which had been taken by the Spartans. He first marched to Amphipolis, and encamped on rising ground near the city. In the meanwhile Brasidas, the Spartan general, who knew what sort of man Cleon was, resolved to deceive him by a trick. He ordered his men not to show themselves on the wall, but to conceal themselves behind the ramparts. Meanwhile he sent out spies to discover how large the forces of Cleon were, and if reinforcements were coming. These men brought back word that the army of the enemy was small, and was not drawn up carefully. Then Brasidas ordered his men to throw open the gates and attack the enemy at once. The Athenians, who did not trust their general, took to flight, and most of them were killed.

## Exercise 122 [B]

The prisoner was brought before the king, who asked him where he had concealed his money. To this the man replied that he had indeed been rich once, but that now all his money had been taken away from him by the soldiers, and that nothing was left. The king asked the soldiers if this was true, but they all declared that they had not taken the gold, and did not know where the prisoner kept it. Then the king said that he would discover by means of tortures who was telling the truth; but the prisoner, being overcome by fear, asked if the king would pardon him when the money was given up. The king promised to do this, whereupon the prisoner said he would show them at once where he had carried the money.

## Exercise 123 [B]

I once went to the house of a celebrated man, who had formerly been a friend of mine, to ask if he would help me in a matter which I had in hand. The servant said he was not at home, but as I had caught sight of my friend, I knew the fellow lied. Some days after the great man came to my house, and I, having no servant, opened the door to him myself. On seeing him I exclaimed, with unmoved countenance, “He is not at home.” In astonishment my friend asked whether I was mad. To which I replied, “I believed your servant when he told lies about you. Are you not willing to believe me when I speak about myself?”

## Exercise 124 [A]

It was the custom of the Falisci to send their children to a schoolmaster to live with him. When the Romans were waging war with the Falisci, this schoolmaster thought that he would please the Romans if he gave them these children as hostages. He therefore purposely led them, without the knowledge of the citizens, to the Roman camp, and offered them to the general. The latter, however, asked him how he had dared to betray children who had been committed to his care, and threatened him with severe punishment. Then he told the children to take such rods as their master was himself accustomed to use, and with these to drive him to the city.

## Exercise 125 [A]

The news reached Rome that their army had been defeated, and that of the two consuls who were in command one had been killed and the other was a fugitive. At first the whole city was full of panic and grief. But soon the Senate assembled to take measures for the safety of the State. They decreed that those who were able to fight should go with the women and children to the capitol; but they declared that they themselves, who were old men and unable to bear arms, would remain in the city. The Gauls found these old men sitting in silence, and clothed in their state robes. At first they wondered greatly, but finally they approached the Senators, and a soldier stroked the long beard of one of them with his hand. The Senator, being enraged, struck the man, whereupon the rest of the Gauls slew all the Senators.

## Exercise 126 [B]

Solon, the wisest of the Athenians, went once to visit Croesus at Sardis. You have all heard how these two men became friends, and discussed many things together. But the story is worthy of being told again. Croesus considered that that man was most fortunate who had great power and riches, and who could do whatever he wished; and he thought that he himself was such a man. He therefore showed Solon all his gold and silver, and told him how many nations he ruled. He then asked him whom he considered the happiest of mortals. He was sure that Solon would answer that he who ruled the city of Sardis and such a great kingdom was the happiest. But Solon replied that two young men, Cleobis and Biton, were the most happy.

## Exercise 127 [B]

Croesus said he had never heard of these men, and asked Solon who they were. The latter replied that they were two youths of great piety, whose mother was a priestess; that when she wished to go to the temple the oxen which used to draw her cart had died, and that her two sons had drawn her there instead of the oxen; that therefore she had prayed to the gods to give them their best gift, and in the night they had both died. By this story Solon wishes to prove that those who are alive must not be accounted happy, since all are liable to misfortune; but that those who have met an honourable death are indeed the happiest.

## Exercise 128 — Impersonal Verbs  

1. In using oportet there is the same difficulty as in using debeo. In English we say, "I ought to have come," expressing the Perfect tense in the Infinitive. In Latin the tense must be expressed in the modal verb, not in the following Infinitive; e.g. Debui venire or oportuit me venire. Tlere is the same difference in the use of possum ; e.g. Potui hoc facere = I might have done this.
2. Remember that se refers to the subject of the sentence. An impersonal verb has no subject, and therefore cannot be followed directly by se; e.g. He was ashamed=eum puduit. If, however, the impersonal is used in an indirect statement se must be used for the third person, because it refers to the subject of the verb of saying; e.g. Dixit se pudere = He said he was ashamed. See Rule 7, p. 40.


- I repented of my crime.

## Exercise 133 [A]

Now when they had sailed for several days, it chanced that they caught sight of a ship of war approaching them. Some were afraid, and wished to turn back, but the captain said that he was ashamed to turn back, “For,” said he, “brave men ought to meet an enemy boldly, and I do not believe that by flight we shall escape from so large a vessel.” As the ship came near they saw that there were on board many soldiers, one of whom, by his proud looks and splendid dress, seemed to be the king. This man called out to them to come on board his ship. And when they had done this he asked them where they came from, and why they had left their homes.

## Exercise 134 [A]

On hearing their answer he asked them to sail with him, and promised to give them lands in his country, because they seemed to be good soldiers, and because he pitied them for their misfortunes. But they declared that they wished to discover what fortune the gods would give them in distant regions. Then the king replied that he was sorry for this resolve, but that he would no longer try to persuade them to follow him. He asked them if they needed gold or provisions; and when they said that they had no need of such things, he dismissed them kindly, and held on his course.

## Exercise 135 [A]

I have lately with much care found out and written in a book the strange stories which the inhabitants of this district believe. Among other things they believe that a man who throws a garment into the stream which flows near our town will be free from disease for a year. I have asked why they believe this, and they say that a god dwells in the stream; but why the god of a river wants such gifts they do not understand. They also believe that a certain spring which rises outside the town is able to make rich the man who visits it on a certain night in the summer; but on which of all the nights of summer one ought to visit the spring no man can tell, and I have never found a man made rich in this way.

## Exercise 136 [A]

The gallant Brutus, who had been blockaded for a long time, wished to know when the reinforcements would arrive. Accordingly he sent away two ships, under the command of his lieutenant, with the intention of informing the Roman commander in what great danger he was. But these ships being wrecked, the enemy surrounded them, and asked the lieutenant who they were and where they came from. On learning that they were Romans, they promised to spare their lives, and be their guides. But when they had led them two miles they surrounded and slew them. The Roman commander, on hearing of this through his scouts, decided not to delay any longer, but to send forward two legions as soon as possible.

## Exercise 137 [B]

When the king of France was besieging Amsterdam the citizens were greatly terrified, and summoned a council to consider what they ought to do. Most of them said that there was no hope of holding out any longer against the enemy, and advised that the keys of the city should be given up to the king. But they observed that one of the elders was asleep, and had not given his opinion. So they woke him up, and asked him what he advised about giving up the keys. He enquired if the king had demanded them; and when they said that he had not done so, he replied, “Then let us wait at least till he be pleased to ask for them.” It is said that these words saved the city.

## Exercise 138 [B]

The soldier, thus recognized, was soon surrounded by a mob of citizens asking who he was, where he came from, where he was going, for what purpose he was in the town, and why he had not come through the gates, but had climbed over the wall in the night time. In no wise terrified, he replied that neither could he answer so many things at once, nor was it the business of private citizens to know what was his name or what he came for. On which he was dragged with much violence to the magistrates, who questioned him again as to his purposes. As he would not speak, they were deliberating whether they ought to detain him or set him free; but there came up a soldier who pretended to recognize the prisoner, and asked whether he had not been seen in the rebels’ camp.

## Exercise 139 [B]

A boy and his sister were once found by the inhabitants of a village, near the entrance of a cavern. They were in form like other men, but they were different in the colour of their skin, which was tinged with a green colour. No one could understand what they said. When they were brought to the house of a certain knight they wept bitterly. Food being set before them they refused to touch it, though it was clear that they were tormented by great hunger. At length, when some beans were brought into the house, they asked by signs that these should be given them. They fed on these with great delight, and for a long time would eat no other food. The boy, however, was always languid and sad, and died in a short time.

## Exercise 140 [B]

The girl, however, becoming accustomed to various kinds of food at length lost that green colour. For many years she remained with the knight to whom she and her brother had first been brought. Being frequently asked about her country, she declared that the inhabitants were of a green colour, and that they saw no sun, but enjoyed such a light as we see after sunset. Being asked how she came into this country, she replied that as they were following their flocks they came to a certain cavern, where they heard a delightful sound of bells. Led on by this they wandered for a long time through the cavern, and at last reached its mouth. When they came out of it they said they were stupefied by the excessive heat of the sun, and were thus caught by the inhabitants of the village.

## Exercise 147 [A]

Hannibal first crossed the Pyrenees with an army of fifty thousand foot soldiers and nine thousand horse, without any difficulty. No Roman army appeared to hinder his march. He reached the Rhone safely, and found no Romans to oppose him. The Gauls, however, were prepared to bar his way, and Scipio, the Roman general, had arrived at Massilia; so Hannibal determined to cross the river without delay. He ordered such boats as were ready to be brought to him, and trees to be cut down from which to build others. In two days the boats were ready, but the Gauls were drawn up on the opposite bank to prevent the landing. Accordingly Hannibal sent a large number of his men some miles up the river, ordering them to cross and attack the Gauls in the rear upon a given signal.

## Exercise 148 [B]

The Carthaginians had now reached the highest point of the mountains; they encamped on a large plateau where they could rest for some days. But it was a cold and desolate place, and not one where they could remain long, especially as winter was approaching. Many had been left behind on the march, overcome with want and hardships; and the cold was terrible to men who came from Spain and Africa. But Hannibal encouraged them, and pointed out that from this place the road led downwards, and that it would soon lead them to a country where they would find friends. “There lies Italy,” cried he; “yonder is the way to Rome.”

## Exercise 153 [A]

While the Romans were waging war against the Samnites their general Postumius tried to lead an army into Samnium through a narrow pass. There is in the midst of this pass a broad and open plain, but in order to reach it an army must enter a narrow defile, and afterwards either it must go back by the same way or must get out by a still narrower defile into Samnium. The Romans reached the open plain, but attempting to proceed they could not escape, for meanwhile the Samnites had blocked both the defiles. To escape they had to climb the mountains, and having tried to do this many times in vain they had to fortify a camp where they were.

## Exercise 154 [B]

Accordingly Postumius sent ambassadors to ask for fair terms. Pontius the Samnite replied that they must give hostages and surrender their arms, and must themselves be sent under the yoke. At length these disgraceful conditions were accepted, and the Romans were allowed to depart. To reach home they had to pass through the country of their Campanian allies, and even ask them for food and clothes. The Roman Senate refused to accept the treaty, and sent back the consul to surrender himself to the Samnites.

## Exercise 158 [A]

News having been brought of Caesar’s approach, the Arverni, fearing that he would invade their territory, resolved to break down all the bridges over the river. Caesar was very anxious to cross as soon as possible, for he was afraid of being hindered all the summer by this river. He accomplished this by the following trick. He sent forward the greater part of his forces, and the enemy followed these, thinking that the whole army had set out. Thereupon Caesar, who had remained with a few men, ordered them to repair one of the bridges with all speed, fearing that they might not be able to finish the work before the return of the enemy.

## Exercise 159 [B]

A peasant on the point of death summoned his sons, and told them that the end of his life was near. “My sons,” he said, “I am not afraid that you will disobey my commands, or forget me when I am dead. I therefore bid you work diligently in my vineyard, for by doing this you will discover great riches.” When the old man died, his sons remembered his words, and began to dig up the soil with all their might, hoping to find great riches concealed there. Soon however they were afraid that they had been deceived, for they could find neither gold nor silver; and at first they regretted their labour. But at last they discovered what their father had intended, for by carefully digging up the ground, they made it so fertile that it produced excellent vines.

## Exercise 162 [A]

The triumph of Camillus, after the fall of Veii, was disliked by the Romans, because he showed too much pride. Amongst other things he was accused of making himself equal to the gods, because he had entered the city in a chariot drawn by four white horses, which were sacred to Jupiter and the Sun. He also made the soldiers still more angry, because he ordered them to return part of the spoils taken at Veii, that he might offer them to the god Apollo. Finally he was accused of having hidden some treasures which he ought to have given up to the people, and was obliged to go into exile.

## Exercise 163 [B]

Some Irishmen had been brought to trial on the charge of stirring up a revolution in their country. They asserted that they had done nothing contrary to the law of nations, since the English were oppressing their land, and they themselves were only trying to free her from an unjust dominion. Under these circumstances they declared that they by no means repented of their deed, especially because they had shown that it was not easy to govern Irishmen against their will. These words displeased many who were present; but since the prisoners were young, and had never before been accused of any crime, they were spared.

## Exercise 164 [A]

Now when the Delphians knew what great danger they were in, great fear fell upon them. In their terror they consulted the oracle concerning the holy treasures, and enquired if they should bury them in the ground, or carry them away to another country. The god replied that they must leave the treasures untouched. “He was able,” he said, “without help to protect his own.” So the Delphians, when they received this answer, began to deliberate how to save themselves. First of all they sent their women and children across the gulf into Achaia. After which the greater number of them climbed to the top of Parnassus, and placed their goods in a cave. In this way all the Delphians quitted the city, except sixty men and the prophet.

## Exercise 165 [A]

A great plague had broken out in the city, and many of the people, both rich and poor, had perished. A great number of those who survived, who had neither wives nor children, resolved to leave the city and sail away to discover new lands. They pitied those whom they were leaving behind, but they knew that they could not help them. Accordingly they set sail by night, and meeting with a favourable wind, were many miles away from the city before dawn. They did not know to what lands they would come, but they had resolved to sail towards the west.

## Exercise 166 [B]

The two armies had been gazing at each other a long time. At last an old man came forward, and asked that a warrior from each army should be chosen to fight for his countrymen. Accordingly Sohrab came forward from the one army and Rustum, his father, from the other; but neither of them knew who the other was. For it happened that when Sohrab was born and carried off by the Scythians, his father was absent. At first Sohrab prevailed; for Rustum hurled his spear with such violence that he slipped and fell on the ground. But quickly rising, he dealt his son a deadly wound; for Sohrab had heard Rustum, as he rushed forward, shout out his name, and knowing him to be his father, he did not even move a hand to defend himself.

## Exercise 167 [B]

King James’s army was far superior to Monmouth’s in numbers, but with such great carelessness did they take up their position on that night that they were almost surprised and destroyed by the rebels. By chance the guides whom Monmouth trusted had not told him that there was a ditch twenty-five feet wide which defended the king’s camp in front. Therefore when the rebels were just going to rush forward to attack the ramparts, they were stopped by this trench. The officers ordered their men to throw the waggons into it, but the guards of the other army were now aroused, and their artillery began to play upon the rebels. It is said that Monmouth, having exhorted his men to fight bravely and hold their ground, himself rode out of the fight, hoping to find some place where he might be safe.

## Exercise 174 [A]

All the world has heard how gallantly Horatius Cocles defended the bridge by which the enemies of Rome hoped to enter the city. First with two companions and afterwards alone he resisted all the attacks made upon him, and prevented the enemy from crossing; and there is no doubt that he was the salvation of the Roman state. Again and again the enemy charged, but were always repulsed with great loss. At last, when the bridge was all but broken by the Romans, his countrymen called to him to come back, and, offering a prayer to the river god, he threw himself into the water. His friends feared that he would be drowned; but contrary to the expectations, both of friends and enemies, he reached the other bank in safety.

## Exercise 175 [B]

In this year the Gauls, under the leadership of Brennus, crossed the Alps, and threatened Rome with war. It is said that they were provoked by certain Roman ambassadors, who violated international law by taking part in a battle fought between the Gauls and Etruscans. As the Senate refused to punish the ambassadors, the Gauls vowed with the help of the gods to avenge this wrong, and set out for Rome. At the river Allia they won a great victory over the Romans, nor were they afterwards opposed. They were greatly amazed at no one trying to prevent their entering Rome, and stopped some time outside the walls.

## Exercise 176 [A]

At the time when Russia had as many enemies as neighbours, the king of Sweden laid siege to Novgorod, and the Swedes soon got possession of the city. There is no doubt that this happened through the carelessness of the inhabitants, and there are some who say it was the result of treachery. But there were some who determined to hold out to the last, and among these was a certain priest. He shut himself up in a house with a few friends, who, animated by his courage, refused to surrender, and fired on the enemy. Messengers were sent again and again to command them to surrender, and at last the enemy set fire to the house. But these brave men chose to be burnt in the house rather than to yield, for they had determined not to survive the independence of their country.

## Exercise 177 [A]

Antiochus greeted the Roman ambassadors on their arrival, and was stretching out his hand to Popilius; but the latter gave him the despatches, and bade him read these first. After reading them through the king said he would consult his friends as to what ought to be done. But Popilius drew a circle round the king with a rod which he was carrying in his hand, and said, “Before you leave this circle give me an answer to take to the Roman Senate.” The king at first was on the point of refusing to obey the ambassador; but he knew that it would be to his advantage to keep the friendship of the Roman people, and at last replied that he would do what the Senate wished. Then at last Popilius stretched out his hand to the king as to a friend and ally.

## Exercise 178 [A]

When ambassadors came to Hannibal in Italy to recall him to Carthage, he received them with great anger, and could hardly refrain from shedding tears. “There is no doubt,” he cried, “that it is not the Romans who have conquered me, but my own people through their hatred and jealousy. Take me where you will; it matters little to me where I go, since I have to leave Italy.”  
The ambassadors were now afraid that he would refuse to serve the state any longer, and tried to persuade him that the most important thing was to defend Carthage. But he replied that a city which feared to trust its generals did not deserve to be defended by them.

## Exercise 179 [B]

Elated by the rapid departure of the Roman fleet from Africa, the Carthaginians still more rejoiced on hearing of its destruction. They could now boast that they were “friends of the sea, and enemies of all who sailed on it.” This being the case the Romans could not prevent them from transferring the war to Sicily, with all the land forces, with one hundred and forty elephants, and with a fleet to help the army. They made straight for that island, and, taking the field, prepared to ravage the open country. But the Romans, with unconquerable resolution, undertook the construction of a new fleet, and within three months two hundred and twenty new vessels had been built, and were ready for action.

## Exercise 180 [B]

The command was entrusted to Xanthippus, who seemed to all to be the man whom they could best trust. A cry was raised for instant battle, for none doubted that they would conquer under the command of Xanthippus. Being thus appointed general, he led his army into the plain, and prepared to give battle to the Romans. He first ordered the elephants to charge the Roman centre, and the cavalry to fall upon the wings on both sides. The Roman horse, who were greatly inferior in numbers, fled without striking a blow, and the elephants, rushing into the foremost ranks of the Roman infantry, laid the enemy low in every direction. Attacked in front by the infantry, on the flanks by the cavalry, and on the rear by the elephants, the majority of the Roman soldiers of the line stood their ground bravely, and died where they were standing.

## Exercise 181 [B]

Ten years after, Caius, the younger brother of Tiberius, thinking he ought to avenge his brother’s death, brought forward laws to upset the whole constitution. The people had not forgotten the death of Tiberius, and all the power of the senators could not prevent their electing Caius tribune of the plebs. But Tiberius had proposed his laws because he pitied the common people; Caius proposed his in order that he might the more easily satisfy his desire for revenge. He was accused also of aiming at kingship. For two years he delivered many speeches before the people, and continued to propose all such laws as might lessen the senate’s power, but the most iniquitous of them was that which caused bread to be given to the common people at a very low rate.

## Exercise 186 [A]

As soon as Demosthenes arrived with his armament before Syracuse, and joined the army of Nicias, the siege was carried on with renewed vigour. At first Nicias’ want of energy prevented even Demosthenes from making a direct assault. But at length Nicias was persuaded to allow his men to assault the city in the night time. This attack had an unfortunate result. The Athenians, before they reached the walls of the Achradina, fell into confusion, and were not far from fighting with one another in the darkness. Demosthenes was obliged to sound a retreat. After this Nicias’ counsel again prevailed, and they determined to reduce the city by famine.

## Exercise 187 [B]

As soon as news reached him of William’s landing, Harold hastened southward by forced marches. Flushed by their recent success, his men did not despair of victory, and spent the night before the battle in feasting and drinking. The battle was stubbornly contested all day, and evening was approaching before it was clear which side would win the day. At length, by feigning retreat, William enticed the enemy from their position, and the Norman cavalry made great havoc in the ranks of the Saxon foot. But not until they saw their king fall, pierced through the eye by an arrow, did the Saxons take to flight. After his death they were routed, and fled in all directions.

## Exercise 194 [A]

Both Demosthenes and the common soldiers were greatly disheartened at this defeat, though Nicias seemed almost to have expected it. He now proposed that the siege should be abandoned, since the gods refused¹ their assistance, and they repeatedly met with disaster. But while they were still disputing² the Syracusans took away from them their last means of flight. In several engagements in the harbour they destroyed the whole Athenian fleet. Now all were eager to retreat, while it was still possible, towards their allies in the western part of the island. But the superstition³ of Nicias deterred them from setting out till the new moon had risen; and meanwhile deserters had betrayed their plans to the Syracusans, who blocked the pass by which alone they could hope to reach the interior.

² *de re disceptatur.*

## Exercise 195 [A]

At length, on the day appointed, they marched several miles until they came to the fatal pass. When they found this beset by the enemy, and all their attacks made no impression,⁴ they first tried to discover some other path by which they could ascend the mountains; then, almost in despair, they determined to make a dash⁵ for the coast, for this purpose dividing their forces into two divisions. Demosthenes was speedily overtaken and surrounded. Nicias met the enemy while crossing a river on the sixth day after he had left Syracuse. But, since his men had found no water to drink for many hours, they could not be restrained from rushing into the water, even when it was red with the blood of their comrades. All order being thus lost,¹ Nicias surrendered at discretion.² He and Demosthenes, being condemned to death, died by poison; the rest of the Athenians were kept in the stone quarries³ at Syracuse.

## Exercise 196 [A]

After surmounting all these obstacles, and so signally defeating the Gauls, Hannibal was all but destroyed, not in open fight, but by ambuscade. He had almost reached the top of the Alps, when some old men came to him in the guise of envoys. The misfortunes of others, they said, had been a warning to them, and they preferred to make trial of the friendship rather than the might of the Carthaginians, and were ready to do whatever he wished. Hannibal, considering that he must not rashly either trust or slight⁴ them, accepted them as guides, but followed with his army in fighting order.⁵ The moment⁶ they entered a narrow pass, the enemy sprang out of their ambuscade on all sides, and assailed him both in front and in rear, both from a distance and at close quarters.

⁴ *aspernari.*  
⁵ *‘prepared for battle’.*  
⁶ *‘as soon as’.*

## Exercise 197 [A]

When the Athenians had attempted without success to capture the island of Sphacteria, an assembly was called to discuss what steps should be taken. At this assembly Cleon, who was only a private citizen, and wholly inexperienced in war, declared that they would never be able to take the island while they employed such generals. “Under my command,” he said, “I am sure that the enemy would not resist¹ us for twenty days.” There is no doubt that he said this only to slight the other generals; but the Athenians at once assigned to him the control of the campaign, and he set out at once for the seat of war. Here, aided by fortune, he accomplished what he had undertaken, contrary to the expectations of all, and within twenty days returned to Athens in triumph.

¹ *Non fore ut hostes resistant.* (Periphrasis for Future Infinitive.)

## Exercise 198 [B]

It was already dawning when the general gave the signal, promising a great reward to the first man who² climbed the walls. No one indeed resisted them as they entered the city, where the walls had been broken down, or climbed by ladders. As soon as the shouting showed that the city had been taken the Asiatics all left their posts, and sought refuge in the citadel. The general allowed his men to plunder the town, partly because he was incensed with the inhabitants, and partly because the soldiers had hitherto always been restrained from plundering captured cities, and he wished them at last to have some reward for their valour. He was indeed accused of having done it to satisfy a grudge.

² Note on superlatives transferred to the relative clause.

## Exercise 199 [B]

A certain man dreamed that he saw an egg hanging from the top of his bed; and when he had been the next day to consult a friend what the meaning of this dream might be, the friend told him that he would find a great quantity of gold hidden under his bed. After he had been digging for several hours he found a large quantity of gold surrounded with silver. Therefore he sent his friend a small part of the silver. The man, being vexed that he had received so small a reward, sent a messenger to ask whether he could not give him part of the yolk¹ of the egg; for (he said) inasmuch as the gold was covered with silver, the god had intended to show him the gold by the yolk and the silver by the rest.² But for my part I am not persuaded that this story is true.

¹ *vitellus.*  
² *reliqua pars.*

## Exercise 200 [B]

This man, although he had been banished from his country on a false charge, did not cease, as often as opportunity was offered, to help her to the best of his ability. He was not the man to put his own prosperity before that of¹ the State; and he used to say that when his countrymen needed him they would recall him; till that time should arrive he was willing to remain in exile. Soon an occasion was offered him to show his devotion.

A conspiracy was formed by some desperate men, who killed the chief magistrates, and assumed supreme power. In this crisis the citizens remembered the exile, and sent messengers to ask him to come to their help. He forgot all the wrongs which he had suffered, and by his arrival brought safety to the State which had treated² him so unjustly.

¹ Omit “that of” in Latin.  
² *‘used’.*

## Exercise 201 [B]

Rutilius was not fit to be made governor of a province. On his departure from Asia, while visiting Ephesus, a city whose inhabitants worship Diana, he had robbed the temple of that goddess. And he did many other such things as would offend all Romans of the old character. And as often as he committed a theft he had a jest to justify¹ it by. He said he always took readily the little golden cups which the statues of the gods held in their outstretched hands. And when his companions asked him whether he did not expect some day to be punished, he said the gods would not punish a man who, after praying to them for benefits, took the first gift which they offered him. When he was old he did just the same things as² he had done when a young man. When on the point of death he said, “One thing I have been repenting for a long time³—that I did not take the golden cloak which Jupiter wears in his temple in Messenia. I could have given him a woollen one for it.”

## Exercise 208 [A]

“Fellow‑soldiers, we have lost many brave men through treachery, and have been abandoned by our friends. But we must not lose heart; and if we cannot conquer, let us choose rather to perish gloriously than to fall into the hands of barbarians, who will inflict upon us the greatest miseries. If our ancestors had not been willing to encounter the vast forces of the Persians, Greece would now be in the hands of the barbarians. If we show ourselves worthy of them, we too shall benefit our country. The gods, the avengers of perjury, will be favourable to us; and seeing that they are offended by the violation of treaties, they will also follow us to battle, and combat for us.”

## Exercise 209 [B]

The general delivered this speech before his men: “You see how great the forces of the enemy are, and how impregnable their position is. If we attack them we shall without doubt suffer a severe defeat. But if, on the contrary, they were to leave their position and attack us, we should have good hopes of victory, for they have to cross a deep river and climb a steep hill before they can reach our lines.” By these words the general with difficulty persuaded his men to remain within their fortifications; and his advice was the salvation of the army. For if the Romans had attacked the enemy, who were superior to them both in numbers and position, they would undoubtedly have been conquered.

## Exercise 210 [A]

After the death of Tib. Gracchus, C. Blosius showed his friendship for him in a marvellous way. For the senate decreed that all who had taken part with¹ Gracchus should be punished. Blosius, when accused before the consuls, excused himself on the ground of his friendship² for Gracchus. “Whether my judges condemn me,” said he, “or whether they acquit me, I shall still always rejoice that I was the friend of Gracchus. If you, consuls, should bid me save my life by accusing Gracchus, I would not so save it. If I must die, let me die loyal to my friends.” The two consuls hesitated. At last one of them asked Blosius, “If Gracchus had ordered you to set fire to the temple of Jupiter, would you have done it?” To which Blosius replied, “Gracchus would not have ordered it.”

¹ *consentire cum.*  
² *amicitiae excusatione uti.*

## Exercise 211 [B]

On receiving news of the approach of Fairfax, the governor of Raglan Castle called together his men, and spoke as follows: “If all were going well, I should not conceive it to be my duty to consult the men whom I command. But since the enemy are already upon us, and we have not collected³ sufficient provisions, if there should be any here faint‑hearted, or any that care not to fight to the death in his Majesty’s cause, let him depart, and be not burdensome to us in the siege. If I am able, I will set him safe on the Welsh⁴ side of the river.” If the king himself had addressed them, the men could not have shown more zeal than they did on hearing this speech.

³ *frumentum comparare.*

9. When I return to Rome I shall find out if anyone has bought my house.
10. An order was given that whoever plundered the houses should be put to death.

## Exercise 214 [A]

If after so great a victory the Gauls had immediately pursued the fugitives, Rome would certainly have been taken, so astonished and terrified were the citizens at the return of those who had escaped from the battle. The Gauls, however, not imagining the victory to be so great as it really was, gave way¹ to feasting and plundering the camp. Accordingly numbers who wished to leave the city had opportunity to escape, while those who remained were able to make preparations for defending the city. The latter, quitting the rest of the city, retired to the Capitol, which they fortified by strong ramparts; for they knew that if the Gauls attacked them they would need all their strength.

¹ *se dedere.*

## Exercise 215 [A]

There can be little doubt that the guides, whether through treachery or ignorance, were mainly responsible for the disaster. If the army had marched by the main road they would have arrived unmolested, and could have joined battle on the following day on equal terms. But following a shorter way across the fields, they found the road blocked on one side by a marsh, and on the other by cliffs. Then the general called together his officers, and said, “If we advance we shall run the risk of being surprised by the enemy; on the other hand, if we retreat we shall perhaps arrive too late. Had we only kept to the main road, we should already be approaching the city.” No one replied at once, and before any plan could be determined the cry was raised that the enemy were upon them.

## Exercise 216 [A]

A young Spartan, named Isadas, distinguished himself particularly in this action. He had neither armour nor clothes upon his body, and he held a spear in one hand and a sword in the other. In this condition he quitted his home with the utmost eagerness, and was the first to enter the battle. He dealt mortal wounds at every blow, and overthrew all who opposed him without receiving any hurt himself. Whether the enemy were dismayed at so strange a sight, or whether the gods preserved him on account of his extraordinary valour, it is certain that no man ever accomplished such marvellous deeds. It is said that after the battle the Ephori decreed him a crown for his valour, but fined him a thousand drachmae for having exposed himself to so great a danger without arms.

## Exercise 217 [A]

On the very day on which the Senate was deliberating whether they ought to summon back to Rome the Master of the Horse, news was brought that he had led out the troops which had been left in the camp, and in a battle with the Samnites had suffered a great disaster. The Dictator would not even wait to learn what the Senate determined, but hurried back to the camp. The Master of the Horse, summoned before the tribunal,¹ was asked why he, to whose care the safety of the Roman people had been entrusted, had without the orders of the Dictator led into battle the legions which he had been ordered to keep within the camp. The only reply he could make was² that he had thought he ought to use the legions which he commanded for the good of the Roman people whenever an opportunity offered.³

## Exercise 218 [A]

An Indian⁴ chief was taken prisoner by the Spaniards, and because he was a man of influence⁵ among the tribes they cut off his hands, with the intention of disabling him⁶ from fighting any more against them. But he, returning home eager to avenge this wrong, incited his countrymen not to let the Spaniards think their accustomed valour had forsaken them. And when they saw the cruelty which the Spaniards had practised⁷ towards him and others his companions, they burnt their homes, to prevent anyone’s wishing to return, and fell upon the Spanish settlement, with minds made up either to drive the Spaniards out of the town or to perish themselves in battle. While the battle was being fought the maimed chieftain himself carried arrows in his mouth with which to supply the combatants.

## Exercise 219 [B]

The Romans, when they heard of the disaster which had befallen Regulus, fitted out a large fleet for the rescue of the survivors; while the Carthaginians, rightly judging that the resolution of the Romans would not be broken by one calamity, also began to build a new fleet to protect them from another invasion. But in vain did they endeavour to reduce Clypea before the Romans could reach it. The small garrison, with surprising courage, repelled all attacks, and held out till the ensuing summer, when the Roman fleet arrived. A naval battle took place off the Hermaean promontory. The Romans gained the day, and took on board the defenders of Clypea who had so well earned their safety.

## Exercise 220 [B]

Hanno was now entrusted with the command. If he had followed the example of Hamilcar, the Romans would without doubt have been defeated. But before he had held the command long he proved himself entirely unworthy of confidence. If ever he won a partial success, he was unable to make use of it; and after having won, as he thought, a complete victory, he allowed his camp to be surprised and taken. For these circumstances the Carthaginians once more offered Hamilcar the command, although they could not expect a man whom they had treated so unjustly before to come to their help. But Hamilcar, still placing his country before all else, consented to take the command. By his strict discipline, by his energy, and by his great influence with the Numidian chiefs, he defeated the enemy in a pitched battle, and recovered a considerable number of cities which had revolted.

## Exercise 221 [B]

When Ulysses was cast upon the island of Phaeacia, he was treated with all the hospitality which in those days strangers used everywhere to receive. Nausicaa, the king’s daughter, was the first person who met him, and she conducted him to her father’s palace. The best raiment which the maidens had woven was bestowed upon him; and he enjoyed the most sumptuous feast which his hosts could provide. On the next day games were held, and he was asked to join in them, an honour which he at first refused. But afterwards, stung by the insults of the king’s son, the only man who forgot his duty to a guest, he showed that his strength was almost as great now as when he fought against Troy, and he surpassed the Phaeacians in their own sports.

## Exercise 222 [B]

If ever a man deserved to be well treated by his fellow‑citizens it was Tib. Gracchus. Son of a father who had pacified Spain (a work in which a whole series of Consuls had failed), and connected by birth with both the conquerors of Africa, he might have easily claimed the first place in the state, if he had been willing to obey the laws without trying to change them. But he had to journey through Etruria to his first province, Spain, and that country, then desolate, devoid of freemen, cultivated by slaves, made such an impression on him that he determined to find a remedy, if he perished in the attempt. All the best men of Rome favoured the laws he proposed, and had not a tribune stood in the way he would have accomplished his work with the goodwill of most, if not all.

## Exercise 223 [A]

2.  Even if you denied this no one would believe you.

10. I should be quite contented even if I had to go into exile for a little time.

5.  I should never believe you, although you bound yourself by an oath.
6.  At this crisis the allies deserted, though they had promised to remain faithful.
7.  We shall still be soldiers, even if the army is disbanded.
8.  The battle raged fiercely for a long time, although we were greatly inferior to the enemy in numbers.
9.  You ought not to say such things in the presence of others, however true you may believe them to be.
10. Although he tried to conceal his indignation, there is no doubt that he was annoyed at this.

## Exercise 227 [A]

Although Lucullus had won many successes, he was unable to bring the war with Mithridates to a close. The king, after defeating Triarius in a pitched battle at Zela, had retreated to the mountains, satisfied with his success, and Lucullus gave orders for pursuit. But however desirous he might himself be of capturing the king, he found his men unwilling to follow him. Most of them had been absent from Italy for nearly twenty years, and since Lucullus had taken the command, they had suffered great hardships. Lucullus, though a good general, had none of that geniality which wins the affection of soldiers, and moreover he had been living in great luxury, though his soldiers often suffered from want. The result was that the army agreed to defend Pontus from Mithridates, but positively refused to undertake a new campaign.

## Exercise 228 [A]

Though the army opposed to Caesar had been much more numerous, he would nevertheless have come out of this campaign victorious. The discipline and experience of his soldiers were such that, although fortune might be adverse, they never lost heart. This appeared especially in the war round Dyrrhachium. Though the lines which they had constructed with so much trouble were assailed and the defenders driven out of them, there was no panic, nor did the soldiers scatter in flight in all directions over the country; but those who survived the defeat kept together, and retreated along the road which led into the mountains. Next day Caesar had again an army, which, though diminished, was prepared to face all dangers manfully.

## Exercise 229 [B]

However men may differ as to Napoleon’s character, there can be no doubt that he acquired a wonderful influence over his soldiers. If they sometimes grumbled at his orders in private, yet, when he led them to battle, there was not a man who was not ready to risk his life for him. They did this, although it was evident that he for his part never tried to spare the lives of his men, but was resolved to crush the enemy, however great the losses on his own side might be. Thus it happened that France came off victorious in so many conflicts, although she was opposed by many powerful enemies at the same time.

## Exercise 230 [B]

The determination of the Athenians remained unshaken, in spite of the desertion of so many of the Greek States. They readily granted to the Spartans the supreme command of the forces by sea as well as by land, although they themselves furnished two‑thirds of the entire fleet. The great Themistocles tried to inspire the other Greeks with some of the enthusiasm which he had aroused in the Athenians. Had he not displayed as much wisdom as valour, the cause of Greek freedom would have been lost. By his advice the confederates bound themselves to resist to the death, and in case of success to consecrate to the Delphian god a tenth part of the property of all Grecian states which had surrendered to the Persians of their own accord.

## Exercise 231 [A]

1.  He behaved just as if he were mad.
2.  He was rewarded just as he deserved.
3.  He fought as if the safety of the State depended on him alone.
4.  I foresaw it all, just as it happened.
5.  As you thought, his only object was to deceive us.
6.  He governs the State, not as circumstances demand, but as if he were setting an example to the rest of mankind.
7.  He is not quite so devoted to us as you think.
8. His performance does not agree with his promise.
9. While1 I value my own safety a great deal, I value that of the State a great deal more.
10. I envy you as being free from all cares of State.
11. As might be expected2 in such times, it was long doubtful which side would conquer.
12. As often happens, he was tired of his task before he had finisled it.

## Exercise 232 [B]

1.  They rushed into the river as if they were mad.
2.  Our men have been defeated, just as I foretold.
3.  It is our duty to treat others just as we wish them to treat us.
4.  It was observed that he often turned round as if someone were pursuing him.
5.  Considering their difficult position, they acted as wisely as they could.
6.  Seeing is a different thing from believing.
7.  There is no doubt that we have less leisure than our ancestors.
8.  Their actions were not always in accordance with their promises.
9.  They joined battle as if they had no fear of defeat.
10. The Greeks were not distinguished by the same virtues as the Romans.
11. He threw himself into the river, as if he really wished to save his enemy.
12. As was to be expected at such a crisis, the general was the only man who remained unmoved.

## Exercise 233 [A]

At the battle of Zama Hannibal showed the same resolution and the same skill in drawing up his line as he had shown fourteen years before at the battle of Cannae. But fortune was against him, and he went into the battle as if he himself knew it. The elephants, which before had often been a source of safety to the Carthaginians, now frightened by the shouting of the Romans, turned upon their own army, and threw the first line into confusion. The mercenaries formed the first line, and as they fell back, the Carthaginians, drawn up in the second line, would not admit them through their ranks, and even charged them as if they were the enemy. This was not contrary to Hannibal’s expectations. He ordered the third line, his veterans brought from Italy, to charge and drive the disorderly rabble off the field. Then at length the battle with the Romans was renewed.

## Exercise 234 [A]

The messengers, as they had been commanded, informed the people that in three days they must leave their homes and depart to another place. These at first made no answer, as if they did not understand what was demanded of them. But the chieftain, who under the circumstances showed great presence of mind, asked the messengers to explain more clearly the reason for this demand. The latter replied that they were only acting in accordance with the orders they had received. Then from the whole village arose loud cries and groans, as if they had undergone sentence of death; and one and all crowded around the messengers, with as much fury and indignation as they could have shown if those men had themselves been responsible for their sufferings.

## Exercise 235 [B]

Antiochus had invaded Egypt at the beginning of spring. But it happened just as some of his followers had foretold. As soon as he approached Alexandria a Roman ambassador, Popillius, met him, and handed him a letter from the Senate. The king read it, and replied that he would call his friends to a council and consider it; but Popillius with his staff drew a line round the king, and bade him not move from the spot before he had given him an answer. Nor did he reply to any of the questions which the king asked him, but stood silent as if he did not hear; until the king, frightened by the ambassador’s boldness, promised to do what the Senate decreed. In like manner, wherever Romans went, they acted as if to them belonged the empire of the world.

## Exercise 236 [B]

On hearing that he had been proscribed by Antony, Cicero fled for refuge to his villa, which was close by the sea, and got on board a ship with the intention of crossing over into Macedonia. He put out several times, but was driven back by adverse winds, and at last returned to his villa, declaring that he would die in the country which he had so often saved. He went to bed, and slept well considering his critical position. His slaves, however, as if foreseeing his danger, aroused him, and placing him in a litter carried him through the woods towards the sea. He was soon overtaken by the soldiers, who had been sent in pursuit of him; and when they came up he forbade his slaves to offer any resistance, and stretching his neck out of the litter bade the soldiers complete their work.

## Exercise 237 [A]

1.  Deliver up to me the hostages I demanded.
2.  Why did they refuse to follow him?
3.  I do not wish to betray these men who are under my protection.

7.  Let us advance to attack the enemy.
8.  Follow me, fellow‑soldiers, and we shall easily overcome the enemy.
9.  We ought not always to consult our own interests.

3.  I told you before what the result of the battle would be.
4.  Give me what I asked you for, and I will depart.

9.  Was he mad to say such things?
10. If this is true, I refuse to help you any longer.
11. Unless help had arrived, all the citizens would have died of starvation.

## Exercise 239 [A]

Put into Oratio Obliqua after a verb in a Historic tense:—

1.  Why have you invaded my country?
2.  Return to your own country.
3.  The Carthaginians attacked us, and 700 of their own men, 200 of ours were killed.
4.  Let us not forget the wrongs of our allies, but avenge them speedily.

9.  Is my friend to be neglected because he is away?
10. Why should I humour a man who is my father’s freedman?

## Exercise 241 [A]

Labienus was the next to speak, and he expressed contempt for Caesar’s forces. They must not imagine, he said, that this was the army which conquered Gaul and Germany. He was present himself at the battles fought in those countries, and was not rashly stating facts beyond his knowledge. A very small fraction of that army survived. Many had been destroyed by pestilence, many had gone home. Had they not heard that regiments had been manufactured at Brundisium out of the wounded that had been left behind? The forces which they saw before them were raw recruits, and most of them came from colonies beyond the Po. Moreover the flower of the army had perished in the two engagements at Dyrrhachium. He himself finally would swear never to return to the camp unless victorious; let all the rest follow his example.

## Exercise 242 [A]

According to the historian Livy, Appius declared to the assembled Senate that he wished he was deaf so that he might not hear the disgraceful counsels which were that day dishonouring the Roman name. He greatly regretted, he said, their change of temper; it was very different from the temper of former days. Whither had their pride and courage fled? Had they not once boasted that they would have opposed Alexander himself, if in the period of their youth he had dared to invade Italy? Let them not now deliver up to Lucanians and wretched Greeks what their fathers had won by the sword.

## Exercise 243 [A]

The terms of peace, heavy though they were, were only such as they expected under the circumstances; and Hannibal dragged down with his own hands from the rostrum an orator who was recommending the continuance of the war. The people were indignant with Hannibal for thus infringing upon their liberty of speech; but Hannibal replied that they must forgive him if, after serving thirty‑six years in the camp, he had forgotten the manners of the forum. Livy relates that the terms agreed upon by Scipio and the Carthaginian government were then referred to the Senate at Rome, and were accepted by them, both because they felt that they were sufficiently severe, and also because they feared that if they rejected them the Carthaginians would renew the war.

## Exercise 244 [A]

The general then summoned a council of war and spoke thus (Or. Obl.): “We must now decide whether it is to our advantage to hold our position or to retreat while we still have the opportunity. The reinforcements, which we have so long expected, have not arrived; and for my part I believe we are no match for the enemy. But I know we can trust the courage and endurance of our men, and if it is your wish, I am prepared to hold out as long as possible. Tell me plainly your opinion, for I shall do nothing without your approval.” When the general had finished his speech, many different opinions were expressed; but at length ’t was decided that, considering the numbers of the enemy, it would be wiser to retreat and not to run the risk of a severe defeat.

## Exercise 245 [A]

Caesar, when the report of the Senate’s action reached him, addressed his soldiers. He told them what the Senate had done, and why they had done it. “For nine years he and his army had served their country loyally, and had won many victories. They had driven the Germans over the Rhine; they had made Gaul a Roman province; and the Senate had now broken the laws of the state, and had deposed the tribunes because they spoke in his defence. They had declared that the state was in danger, and had called Italy to arms, when he himself had in no wise injured them.” The soldiers whom Pompey supposed disaffected declared with one consent that they would follow their commander and the tribunes. In all the army only one officer proved false.

## Exercise 246 [A]

When Sulla had overcome his enemies and assumed supreme power, he assembled the senate and demanded with the utmost eagerness that Caius Marius should at once be declared an enemy to the state. No one dared to oppose him until Scaevola, on being questioned, refused to express an opinion. When, however, Sulla repeatedly asked him in a threatening voice to give his opinion, at length he replied (Or. Obl.): “You may show me the troops of soldiers with which you have surrounded the senate house; you may threaten me with death again and again; but you will never compel me to say that Marius, by whom the Roman state was saved, is an enemy to Rome.”

## Exercise 247 [A]

There are men in our times who seem to desire not only to change the laws (which perhaps would be a laudable desire), but to upset the whole state. I was listening to one such yesterday as he addressed a crowd of artisans in the forum (Or. Obl.). “Who is it,” he asked them, “that oppresses us? Who is it for whom we pile up wealth, while we want ourselves money to buy food? You yourselves can answer the question, nor is there any need for me to tell you. Our senators have the power to prevent good laws being carried, and M. Crassus buys the consulship every year for himself and his friends. Fellow‑citizens, there is only one remedy—let us drive them from the city. Let us teach them by fire and bloodshed how great a wrong they have done to the people.”

## Exercise 248 [A]

Three days after the setting out of the troops from Rome the gloomy intelligence arrived that the enemy, after having utterly routed the Roman army on the 12th of March, were now in possession of the city of Corioli, and all the territory and other property of the allies (Or. Obl.). “I am the only man,” said the messenger, “who has survived the battle. The enemy, flushed with recent victory, are coming in, and must even now be not more than three miles from the city. So savage is their temper, that I am sure no one, however old and infirm, will be spared.” Having heard this the Senate determined at once to send envoys to meet the enemy on their approach, with the intention of suing for peace.

## Exercise 249 [B]

He had now won a decisive victory, and it seemed certain that the campaign would shortly be brought to a successful issue, when all his hopes were dashed to the ground by the refusal of his troops to continue the war. They declared that they were worn out with the hardships of the campaign, and that the prospect of bringing the war to an end seemed as distant as ever. Why, they asked, must they leave their country and all that was dear to them and undergo every kind of suffering that their general might win the glory of a barren victory? They asserted that, even if they pursued the enemy, they would be unable to overtake them in their mountain fastnesses, while even the victories which they had already won had been purchased at the cost of much Roman blood.

## Exercise 250 [B]

The general replied that no one could be more anxious than himself to consult the interests of his men; but he reminded them how foolish it was to lose the advantages of a victory well‑nigh assured. They must not think, he said, that he had undertaken this campaign merely in the hope of winning glory for himself. They would share equally with him in the fruits of victory; and if once the enemy were crushed, they might return home enriched with spoils taken from the enemy. He also pointed out that though the enemy were seeking refuge in the mountains, they had not yet reached them, and that if an immediate advance were made, it would be easy to overtake them before they reached a place of safety.

## Exercise 251 [B]

Turn into Or. Obl. after a Historic tense:—

Do not believe what is commonly asserted in the city, that I am seeking the consulship for the sake of a province and the wealth that many of our senators steal from the subject states of Rome. Can you think that I, who was once the dear friend of Cato, am so changed in mind? Indeed, I had rather give up all hope of office than involve myself in such disgrace. I have heard recently that the publicani of Cilicia asked our friend Cicero to give them his legionaries to collect the taxes with. He refused at first, but afterwards was prevailed upon. If they were not Romans the very soldiers would refuse to take part in such cruel work. But let us try to devote ourselves to philosophy, and forget evils which we cannot cure.

## Exercise 252 [B]

On this night the king gathered round him his little band of followers, and in a few words said farewell to them (Or. Obl.). “Gentlemen,” he said, “your fortune has so long been linked with mine that the word which I speak to‑night nothing but the last necessity forces me to utter. If there were yet a hope, I would still make use of your loyalty and your aid. Do not think that I value these lightly. You are the few who, having enjoyed with me the times of prosperity, refused to desert me in adversity. And for this I thank you. But permit me now to think of your safety, for the sake of which I shall to‑morrow give myself up. Why should I destroy you with myself? When the rebels have me in their hands they will perhaps leave you free to escape whither you will.”

## Exercise 253 [B]

Hearing of these immense numbers, Robert Guiscard assembled a council of his principal officers (Or. Obl.). “You behold,” said he, “your danger: you see how urgent mit is. The hills are covered with arms and standards; and the Emperor of the Greeks is accustomed to wars and triumphs. Union is our only safety. Only bid me, and I am ready at once to yield the command to a worthier leader.” The acclamation even of his foes assured him at this perilous moment of their confidence; and he thus continued (Or. Obl.), “Let us trust in the reward of victory, and let us not leave cowards the means of escape. Burn your vessels and your baggage, and give battle on this spot.” This resolution was unanimously approved, and Guiscard awaited in battle array the approach of the enemy. Perhaps he was not conscious that on the same ground Caesar and Pompey had formerly disputed the empire of the world.

## Exercise 254 [B]

Turn into Or. Obl. after a Historic tense:—

I might have gone to Spain, where I should have had my brother to share my labours, and Hasdrubal instead of Hannibal for my foe. But hearing as I sailed along the coast of the arrival of the enemy in Gaul, I landed immediately, sent on my cavalry before, and moved my camp up to the Rhone. I am anxious to try whether Carthage in the last twenty years has produced a new race of citizens, or whether these are the same men whom we held so cheap when we let them go from Eryx. Would that this contest were for honour merely, not for very life! But you are fighting for Italy itself, and for your homes; nor is there another army in your rear to bar the enemy’s way if you fail to conquer him. Let each one of you consider that the Senate is watching him, and that the fate of Rome depends upon his valour.

## Exercise 255 [A]

Meanwhile the Carthaginians, knowing the weakness of their naval force at Lilybaeum, and fully conscious that the place would not hold out unless they sent help, resolved to despatch troops at once. Hannibal, son of Hamilcar, was despatched with all haste to Sicily with fifty ships and 10,000 troops. He moved his fleet among the Aegatian islands opposite to Lilybaeum, waiting the moment when he should be able to pass the rocks and reefs that girt the harbour. At length a favourable wind sprang up. He set sail, and, massing his troops on deck to be ready for an engagement, with a boldness that deserved success he made his way safely through the narrow entrance. In the meanwhile the Roman ships remained at anchor close by, the sailors looking on aghast at his rashness, and expecting to see him dashed against the rocks.

## Exercise 256 [B]

The fight was fierce and tumultuous. The assailants were repulsed in their first attack, and several of their bravest officers were shot down in the act of storming the fortress sword in hand. The assault was renewed with greater success. The Indians were driven from one post to another. They disputed their ground inch by inch, fighting with the utmost fury. Most of their veterans were cut to pieces, and after a long and bloody battle Philip and Canonchet, with a handful of surviving warriors, retreated from the fort and took refuge in the thickets of the neighbouring forest. The victors set fire to the wigwams and forts; the whole was soon in a blaze; many of the old men, the women, and the children, perished in the flames.
