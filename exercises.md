## Sequence of tenses

**Rule I.** The tenses in Latin are divided into two groups:

| Group | Indicative | Subjunctive |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| A. Primary tenses | Present. <br>Future. <br>Perfect with “have.” | Present. <br>Perfect. |
| B. Historic tenses | Imperfect. <br>Perfect without “have.” (Aorist.)  <br>Pluperfect. | Imperfect. <br>Pluperfect. |

Where we have a dependent sentence with its verb in the Subjunctive, the tense of the Subjunctive is determined by the tense of the principal verb. Primary tenses follow Primary, Historic tenses follow Historic.[^1]

The English will generally make it quite clear which of the two Primary tenses, or which of the two Historic tenses, is required in each case.

## Exercise 1.

In the following sentences Latin requires the dependent verb to be in the Subjunctive. Say (without translating) what tense you would put it in.

1. They have come in order that they may conquer us.
2. They sent money that we might buy our freedom.
3. We had already succeeded so well that we hoped to win.
4. We are so tired that we cannot work.
5. He ran so quickly that no one could catch him.
6. We do not know what he is doing.
7. Have you heard what he has done?
8. They did not know what the island was like.
9. We shall ask what he is doing.
10. We asked whether the war had been finished.
11. I do not know how many ships there were.
12. We were wondering why you feared us.
13. Tell me why you are afraid.
14. We shall work in order that we may become rich.

## Final Sentences

**Rule 2.** Final Sentences (i.e. sentences expressing a *purpose*) have their verbs in the Subjunctive, introduced by *ut* when positive, by *ne* when negative.

### Examples

- Laborant pauperes **ut** divites **fiant**.

  *Poor men work to become rich.*

- Se receperunt **ne** consilia ab hostibus **cognoscerentur**.

  *They retreated in order that their plans might not be discovered by the enemy.*

## Notes

[^1]: The Historic Present may be regarded either as a Primary or as a Historic tense. The Imperative is always followed by a Primary tense.
[^2]: domum
[^3]: summus collis. So with some other words: *the middle **of the** stream*=medium flumen. *all **of** us*=omnes nos. *the rest **of the** army*=reliquus exercitus. *the whole **of the** city*=tota urbs. *the end **of the** year*= extremus annus. In all these Latin uses *adjectives* where English uses the words 'rest', 'all', 'middle', etc., as *nouns*.
